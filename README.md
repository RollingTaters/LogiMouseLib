# LogiMouseLib
Arduino Library for Logitech Gaming Mice using USB-Host-Shield 2.0 Library

Supports reading mouse movement, Left/Right Click, Middle Mouse Click, Scroll, Left and Right tilt, and All side buttons. G9 (button behind scoll wheel lock does not work)

Current only supports Logitech G502. Tested with Proteus Core and Hero.

I have intentions to develop this for as many Logitech gaming mice as the framework can support.
